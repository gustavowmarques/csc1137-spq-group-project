# CSC1137 – Software Process Quality  
## Group Project (Semester Long)

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains the semester-long group project for the module  
**CSC1137 – Software Process Quality**.

The objective of this project is to design and implement a software application while
demonstrating **high-quality software engineering practices**, including:

- Agile development methodologies (Scrum / XP)
- Software Quality Assurance (SQA)
- Test-driven and shift-left testing approaches
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Code reviews and quality metrics

The emphasis of this project is **process quality as well as product quality**.

## Team Information

- **Team Size:** 6  
- **Module:** CSC1137 – Software Process Quality  
- **Institution:** Dublin City University (DCU)
- **Semester:** Semester 2, 2026

> Team roles (Scrum Lead, QA Lead, DevOps, etc.) will be defined during Phase 1.

---

## Project Domain

> **Note:**  
> The final project topic (e.g. MediTrack, CanvasLite, SafeFlight) will be confirmed
> during Phase 1 (Inception & Planning).  
> This repository is intentionally topic-neutral during Sprint 0.

---

## Development Approach

The project follows an **Agile, incremental development lifecycle**:

- Sprint-based delivery
- User Stories with acceptance criteria
- Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD)
- Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions
- Mandatory code reviews via Pull Requests

## Quality Assurance Focus

Quality is designed **from the start**, not added at the end.

Planned testing activities include:

- Black Box Testing  
  - Equivalence Partitioning  
  - Boundary Value Analysis  
  - Decision Tables  
- White Box Testing  
  - Unit tests with coverage targets  
- Continuous Regression Testing  
- Static Code Analysis  
- Basic Security Testing

---

## Continuous Integration

A CI pipeline is configured to:

- Automatically build the project on each push
- Run automated tests
- Enforce baseline quality checks

This pipeline will be expanded in later phases to include:
- Coverage reporting
- Static analysis
- Regression testing
