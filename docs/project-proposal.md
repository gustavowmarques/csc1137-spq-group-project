# CSC1137 – Software Process Quality  
## Phase 1: Project Proposal

---

## 1. Project Identification

**Project Title:**  
> *To be finalised (working title)*

**Module:** CSC1137 – Software Process Quality  
**Team Name:** [Team Name]  
**Team Size:** 6  
**Semester:** [Semester / Year]

---

## 2. Project Overview

This project involves the design and development of a software application using
industry-aligned **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** practices.

The primary objective is not only to deliver functional software, but to demonstrate
a **high-quality software development process**, including Agile planning, early test
design, continuous integration, and structured verification activities.

The system will be developed incrementally across four phases, with a strong emphasis
on **process quality**, traceability, and testability.

---

## 3. Project Domain and Problem Statement

**Domain:**  
> *To be confirmed (e.g. Healthcare, Education, Travel)*

**Problem Statement:**  
Briefly describe the real-world problem the system aims to address.  
This should focus on:
- Lack of reliability, safety, or efficiency in the current process
- Risks that can be mitigated through better software quality and testing

*(High-level only — no technical design at this stage.)*

---

## 4. Target Users and Stakeholders

The system is intended for the following user roles:

- **Primary Users:**  
  - [Role 1]  
  - [Role 2]

- **Secondary Users / Stakeholders:**  
  - [Role 3, if applicable]

Each role will have different permissions and responsibilities, which will be used
later to support security and access-control testing.

---

## 5. High-Level Functional Scope

The initial functional scope of the system includes:

- Core feature 1  
- Core feature 2  
- Core feature 3  
- Core feature 4  

These features are intentionally defined at a **high level** and will be refined into
User Stories during backlog creation.

---

## 6. Quality and Testing Focus

From the outset, the project adopts a **shift-left testing strategy**, where quality
assurance activities are planned before full implementation begins.

Key quality considerations include:

- Input validation and boundary conditions
- Business decision logic correctness
- Data integrity and consistency
- Role-based access control and security
- Maintainability and testability

These considerations will directly inform the test strategy developed in Phase 2.

---

## 7. Agile Process and Planning Approach

The project will follow an **Agile development approach**, incorporating:

- Iterative development using short sprints
- A prioritised backlog of User Stories
- Clear **Definition of Ready (DoR)** and **Definition of Done (DoD)**
- Continuous feedback through reviews and demonstrations

Progress will be tracked using GitHub Issues and a GitHub Projects board.

---

## 8. Initial Infrastructure Setup

To support collaborative development and quality assurance, the following
infrastructure will be established during Phase 1:

- **Version Control:** GitHub repository with protected branches
- **Branching Strategy:**  
  - `main` (stable)  
  - `develop` (active development)
- **Continuous Integration:**  
  - Automated build and test pipeline using GitHub Actions
- **Issue Tracking:** GitHub Issues linked to User Stories

This setup mirrors standard industry “Sprint 0” practices.

---

## 9. Expected Outcomes of Phase 1

By the end of Phase 1, the team aims to have:

- A clearly defined project scope and direction
- An initial backlog of User Stories with acceptance criteria
- Defined Agile process rules (DoR and DoD)
- A functioning CI pipeline
- A structured repository ready for Phase 2 design and testing activities

---

## 10. Declaration of Authorship and AI Non-Usage

This section will be completed and signed by all team members prior to final submission,
in accordance with the module’s academic integrity requirements.
