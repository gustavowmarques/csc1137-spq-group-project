# MediTrack – User Stories & Planning Game

This document captures the high-level user stories for the MediTrack Patient Management System.
These stories represent units of customer-visible functionality and are used for planning and estimation as introduced in Week 1 (Stories & Planning Game).

Detailed acceptance criteria and test cases are defined separately and will be refined in later phases.

## Notes
- These stories are intentionally **high-level** to support planning and estimation.
- They form the basis for:
  - Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
  - Black Box test design (Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis)
  - Identification of high-risk modules in Phase 2
